She put it on her finger; I did not see it afterwards; I was about five minutes in her bed-room - I made no proposals to her; I only went to sell my goods; the officer saw the mark of the blow on my forehead - I did not kiss her; her clothes were not disordered when she came down.

The officer went up and searched, but the ring was not found; she said I had given her the glass, having taken liberties with her, but I had not - it is against my Religion; she said she would look for my ring.

He brought an officer - I gave up the glass, and told what I had it for. . I am an historical-engraver. I saw the prosecutor at the Northumberland Arms public-house, Clerkenwell-green, yesterday, about half an hour after this bill was found; he told me he was sorry for what he had done, but he was urged by the baker, and that it was very probable the ring had rolled away, and the servant got it.

I held the prisoner fast till two watchmen came up. My gold seals, and part of my chain were gone, they broke by the violence of the pull - he had got from my hold before the watchmen came up - they secured him; they were worth about three guineas. I am sure I had hold of them while the prisoner was attempting to get them from me; I have no doubt of his being the man.

The person snatched at the seals - A. Yes; the seals might have been separated before I seized his wrist, it was done instantly - I am positive of his person; I found him at the watch-house in four or five minutes.

I jumped over Phillips, and pursued the prisoner - I saw another man near Phillips; the prisoner left him first, and was about a yard from him when I first caught sight of him, the second person was then between me and Phillips, we could not pass him to follow the prisoner till we got to where the court widened (he ran down the court); the second man squatted down to hinder me. Phillips called out, \\\"That is him?\\\" I kept within twenty yards of him, and only lost sight of him in turning the corner - he was stopped in my sight.

I am certain he is the man. Phillips brought a hat to the watch-house, which he claimed. We were obliged to push by another man in the court to pursue him. Cross-examined. Q.

When he came down he stated his apprehensions, and having seen some blood on the stairs leading to the yard, he asked for a candle - I went with him to the privy, and found an infant laying on its back, with the head and part of the neck in the soil; I sent for a person who came in half an hour, and took it up - it was put into a box unwashed. I could see no marks of violence on it in the state it was then in. The constable nailed the box down, and put it in the front vault of my house, and nailed up the door. This was late on Saturday evening - it remained there till Monday morning, when Howell took it away. Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Watson took the child from the privy - A. Yes.

I first went to the privy, and on throwing down a piece of lighted paper, I saw the child laying on its back, and the head depressed on the soil. The chest and face were visible, but sunk a little in the soil; Mr. Ellis sent for Watson to take it up; I did not observe any thing about its neck - I went up stairs to the prisoner with Mrs. Ellis, who introduced me as a medical man, and left me with her; I asked if she wished for my assistance, she said No, that she had been poorly, but was better - this was all that passed. Q. Then you had no reason to suppose from what passed, that she had been recently brought to bed - A. Not the least; the child appeared not to have come to maturity by a month or two - I am induced to think it was born alive by its general healthy appearance, but cannot say it was so. A feeling similar to an inclination to stool, is very common in pregnancy. I opened the body and found the lungs inflated, and from that I think it had breathed, but that is not conclusive - it might have imbibed sufficient air, even in parturition so as to have inflated the lungs. Q. You cannot say it was born alive - A. Certainly not. . I am a night-man. I went to the privy with a light, and saw the child laying on the surface of the soil on its back, with its head in the soil; one of my men got it up and put it into a box, it was quite naked; I observed nothing about its body. . I summoned the Coroner's Inquest, and was sent for the body of the child on the 7th, to take it before the Inquest - I went to Mr. Ellis's vault; the servant unnailed the door in my presence, and gave me the box, I took it to St. Marylebone workhouse, and unnailed it, and left it for two hours with the nurses to be washed - I then called for it, and found it laying on a clean table, and a piece of a silk handkerchief laying by its side, which the nurse tied round the neck - I myself had not seen it on the neck before.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"evidence_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 965.0817498483395,\n        \"min\": 6.25,\n        \"max\": 19058.25,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1827,\n        \"samples\": [\n          129.75,\n          1444.0,\n          1177.75\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"valid\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I saw the prisoner looking out of a window; she asked what I had to sell; I said jewellery; she told me to come in - the door was open - I went into the parlour, where I saw her and two other women; she said, \\\"Let us see what you have got?\\\" I put my box on the table, and opened it: the prisoner said she should like to buy something, but she had no money; I said I would take old silver or rings in exchange; she said, \\\"Let us go into my room, and very likely I have got some there;\\\" she took me into a room up two pair of stairs; I put my box on a table; she took hold of a coral ring, tried it on her finger, and asked the price; I said 8s.: she then took up a French opera-glass, and asked the price, which was 4s. - she put that into her bosom; I said, \\\"Now, where are your old rings?\\\" she began to laugh at me; she then collared me, and turned me out of the room - the other girls were down stairs; I went down, and tried to get out, but the street door was locked; she followed me down stairs - there was one of the other women in the passage; I passed her, and went up to the door; the prisoner then came up to me in the passage, and struck me on the side of my head; I fainted away nearly, I was so frightened when she struck me; the servant came up from the kitchen, and said,\\\"What is the matter?\\\" I said I was not well, and asked for cold water, which she brought me; I washed my face, and got better: I then said to the prisoner, \\\"Pray open the door - I want to go about my business?\\\" she said,\\\"You had better come into the parlour, and open your box, to see if you have lost any thing;\\\" I said I knew I had lost the ring and opera-glass, and would not go into the parlour; she said, \\\"You shall not go out if you don't look - may be you will find them in your box;\\\" I said \\\"I cannot open my box here, for I am afraid I shall lose more, and if you don't open the door, I'll make a row here;\\\" she then opened it; I went out, and went to a baker's-shop, at the corner, and told them what had happened: I waited there about half an hour, till an officer came by, and I went with him to the house; he asked the prisoner to give my property back; she took the opera-glass from her bosom, and gave him; she had the ring on her finger. Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she take the ring off her finger up stairs? A. She put it on her finger; I did not see it afterwards; I was about five minutes in her bed-room - I made no proposals to her; I only went to sell my goods; the officer saw the mark of the blow on my forehead - I did not kiss her; her clothes were not disordered when she came down. I swear there was a lock on the door, and it was locked. The officer went up and searched, but the ring was not found; she said I had given her the glass, having taken liberties with her, but I had not - it is against my Religion; she said she would look for my ring. I swear I never said to any body, that the ring might have rolled away, and the servant got it. . I am an officer.

Her hair was loose, and her bosom open, and when we were up stairs she pointed to the bed, which was tossed about, and stated, before his face, that he had taken liberties with her.

He brought an officer - I gave up the glass, and told what I had it for. . I am an historical-engraver. I saw the prosecutor at the Northumberland Arms public-house, Clerkenwell-green, yesterday, about half an hour after this bill was found; he told me he was sorry for what he had done, but he was urged by the baker, and that it was very probable the ring had rolled away, and the servant got it. COURT. Q. How came you there? A. I went to inquire after the prisoner, knowing her brother. I have worked for the late Sheriff Kelly twelve or fourteen years; we drank together. I knew nothing of the prisoner. The officer was not present. JOHN PRIECE re-examined. There was a lump on the side of the prosecutor's head - he complained of being struck in the passage.

On Saturday night, the 15th of June, I heard a cry of Stop thief! ran across, and found Williams in the hands of Deacon, the patrol.

About a quarter before nine o'clock on the evening of the 24th of August, I was going down the Minories , and at the corner of Red Lion-court the prisoner made a sudden rush at me, and darted at my watch, I put my hand down to protect it, and seized his hands about the wrist - at that time, I believe, he had the seals in hand - and at that instant I was pulled down by some person from behind; I had seen a man at my side when he came up - I felt a stronger jerk at my chain as I was falling. I held the prisoner fast till two watchmen came up. My gold seals, and part of my chain were gone, they broke by the violence of the pull - he had got from my hold before the watchmen came up - they secured him; they were worth about three guineas. I am sure I had hold of them while the prisoner was attempting to get them from me; I have no doubt of his being the man. I found a hat in a doorway at the corner of the court where we had the struggle, I took it to the watch-house, and he claimed it as his own. Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The person snatched at the seals - A. Yes; the seals might have been separated before I seized his wrist, it was done instantly - I am positive of his person; I found him at the watch-house in four or five minutes. There is a public-house at the other corner of the court, the hat was in the doorway of a private house - nobody came from the public-house. I swear to his dress as well as his countenance. . I am a slop-seller, and live directly opposite the spot, in the Minories. I was standing at my door, heard a noise on the opposite side, instantly ran over, found Phillips on the ground, and the prisoner just leaving him, without a hat. I jumped over Phillips, and pursued the prisoner - I saw another man near Phillips; the prisoner left him first, and was about a yard from him when I first caught sight of him, the second person was then between me and Phillips, we could not pass him to follow the prisoner till we got to where the court widened (he ran down the court); the second man squatted down to hinder me. Phillips called out, \\\"That is him?\\\" I kept within twenty yards of him, and only lost sight of him in turning the corner - he was stopped in my sight.

I am a linen-draper, and live next door to Dudderidge, whom I was talking to, when we heard a rush, we ran across, saw Phillips laying down in the court, and followed the prisoner, Dudderidge was before me - I only lost sight of the prisoner while he turned the corner. I am certain he is the man. Phillips brought a hat to the watch-house, which he claimed. We were obliged to push by another man in the court to pursue him. Cross-examined. Q. What became of the man who stopped him - A. I do not know. I called out Stop thief! the man popped out of a door, put his arms across to stop him, he fell, and I took him. . I am a constable.

On the 4th of February , my wife gave me\\\\ in\\\\ formation - I went into the kitchen between seven and eight o'clock at night; Mr. Ellis pointed out something to me on the floor, in consequence of which I fetched Mr. Kerr, and stated my suspicions, and Mr. Ellis spoke to him - he went up to see the prisoner in her bed room. When he came down he stated his apprehensions, and having seen some blood on the stairs leading to the yard, he asked for a candle - I went with him to the privy, and found an infant laying on its back, with the head and part of the neck in the soil; I sent for a person who came in half an hour, and took it up - it was put into a box unwashed. I could see no marks of violence on it in the state it was then in. The constable nailed the box down, and put it in the front vault of my house, and nailed up the door. This was late on Saturday evening - it remained there till Monday morning, when Howell took it away. Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Watson took the child from the privy - A. Yes. Mr. Kerr was present - the soil only covered it as far as the chest. MR. . I am an apothecary. On the 4th of January, Mr. Ellis sent for me about eight o'clock in the evening. I first went to the privy, and on throwing down a piece of lighted paper, I saw the child laying on its back, and the head depressed on the soil. The chest and face were visible, but sunk a little in the soil; Mr. Ellis sent for Watson to take it up; I did not observe any thing about its neck - I went up stairs to the prisoner with Mrs. Ellis, who introduced me as a medical man, and left me with her; I asked if she wished for my assistance, she said No, that she had been poorly, but was better - this was all that passed. Q. Then you had no reason to suppose from what passed, that she had been recently brought to bed - A. Not the least; the child appeared not to have come to maturity by a month or two - I am induced to think it was born alive by its general healthy appearance, but cannot say it was so. A feeling similar to an inclination to stool, is very common in pregnancy. I opened the body and found the lungs inflated, and from that I think it had breathed, but that is not conclusive - it might have imbibed sufficient air, even in parturition so as to have inflated the lungs. Q. You cannot say it was born alive - A. Certainly not. . I am a night-man. I went to the privy with a light, and saw the child laying on the surface of the soil on its back, with its head in the soil; one of my men got it up and put it into a box, it was quite naked; I observed nothing about its body. . I summoned the Coroner's Inquest, and was sent for the body of the child on the 7th, to take it before the Inquest - I went to Mr. Ellis's vault; the servant unnailed the door in my presence, and gave me the box, I took it to St. Marylebone workhouse, and unnailed it, and left it for two hours with the nurses to be washed - I then called for it, and found it laying on a clean table, and a piece of a silk handkerchief laying by its side, which the nurse tied round the neck - I myself had not seen it on the neck before.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"evidence_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 965.0817498483395,\n        \"min\": 6.25,\n        \"max\": 19058.25,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1827,\n        \"samples\": [\n          129.75,\n          1444.0,\n          1177.75\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"valid\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I am a native of Poland, and a licensed hawker . On the 11th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I went down Denmark-court, opposite Beaufort-buildings, Strand . I saw the prisoner looking out of a window; she asked what I had to sell; I said jewellery; she told me to come in - the door was open - I went into the parlour, where I saw her and two other women; she said, \\\"Let us see what you have got?\\\" I put my box on the table, and opened it: the prisoner said she should like to buy something, but she had no money; I said I would take old silver or rings in exchange; she said, \\\"Let us go into my room, and very likely I have got some there;\\\" she took me into a room up two pair of stairs; I put my box on a table; she took hold of a coral ring, tried it on her finger, and asked the price; I said 8s.: she then took up a French opera-glass, and asked the price, which was 4s. - she put that into her bosom; I said, \\\"Now, where are your old rings?\\\" she began to laugh at me; she then collared me, and turned me out of the room - the other girls were down stairs; I went down, and tried to get out, but the street door was locked; she followed me down stairs - there was one of the other women in the passage; I passed her, and went up to the door; the prisoner then came up to me in the passage, and struck me on the side of my head; I fainted away nearly, I was so frightened when she struck me; the servant came up from the kitchen, and said,\\\"What is the matter?\\\" I said I was not well, and asked for cold water, which she brought me; I washed my face, and got better: I then said to the prisoner, \\\"Pray open the door - I want to go about my business?\\\" she said,\\\"You had better come into the parlour, and open your box, to see if you have lost any thing;\\\" I said I knew I had lost the ring and opera-glass, and would not go into the parlour; she said, \\\"You shall not go out if you don't look - may be you will find them in your box;\\\" I said \\\"I cannot open my box here, for I am afraid I shall lose more, and if you don't open the door, I'll make a row here;\\\" she then opened it; I went out, and went to a baker's-shop, at the corner, and told them what had happened: I waited there about half an hour, till an officer came by, and I went with him to the house; he asked the prisoner to give my property back; she took the opera-glass from her bosom, and gave him; she had the ring on her finger. Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did she take the ring off her finger up stairs? A. She put it on her finger; I did not see it afterwards; I was about five minutes in her bed-room - I made no proposals to her; I only went to sell my goods; the officer saw the mark of the blow on my forehead - I did not kiss her; her clothes were not disordered when she came down. I swear there was a lock on the door, and it was locked. The officer went up and searched, but the ring was not found; she said I had given her the glass, having taken liberties with her, but I had not - it is against my Religion; she said she would look for my ring. I swear I never said to any body, that the ring might have rolled away, and the servant got it. . I am an officer. I was passing the baker's shop, and saw the prosecutor there; he complained of losing a ring and an opera-glass, and took me to the house; I went in, and asked if the young woman was in - the prisoner came up from the kitchen; I said, \\\"This gentleman says you have robbed him;\\\" she said, \\\"I have not\\\"- she then took this glass from her bosom, and said, \\\"He gave me this for a certain purpose, but I have no ring - you may search.\\\" I went up stairs - she wished to go before a Magistrate, and we went; I did not examine to see if there was a lock on the door. Cross-examined. Q. In what state was she? A. Her hair was loose, and her bosom open, and when we were up stairs she pointed to the bed, which was tossed about, and stated, before his face, that he had taken liberties with her. Prisoner's Defence. He proposed to go up stairs; he gave me the glass in the parlour, and said it was worth a guinea, and I should give him 3s. to boot; he never opened his box up stairs; he put it on the foot of the bed; I said,\\\"Have you no money?\\\" he seized me by my hair, and went out. He brought an officer - I gave up the glass, and told what I had it for. . I am an historical-engraver. I saw the prosecutor at the Northumberland Arms public-house, Clerkenwell-green, yesterday, about half an hour after this bill was found; he told me he was sorry for what he had done, but he was urged by the baker, and that it was very probable the ring had rolled away, and the servant got it. COURT. Q. How came you there? A. I went to inquire after the prisoner, knowing her brother. I have worked for the late Sheriff Kelly twelve or fourteen years; we drank together. I knew nothing of the prisoner. The officer was not present. JOHN PRIECE re-examined. There was a lump on the side of the prosecutor's head - he complained of being struck in the passage.

On Saturday night, the 15th of June, about ten o'clock, I was going along Whitechapel , and saw the prisoner Williams; I believe it was him, but my eye is rather dim; he drew my watch out of my fob. There was a crowd; I called Stop thief! and he ran off. . I am patrol of Whitechapel. On Saturday night, the 15th of June, I heard a cry of Stop thief! ran across, and found Williams in the hands of Deacon, the patrol. I saw Norris standing close by him; he said it was merely a lark, that it was just a cry of Stop thief! among themselves - I took him to the watch-house; he resisted, but very little. I searched them both, but found nothing on them. . I am a butcher, and live in Spectacle-alley, Whitechapel. I heard the cry of Stop thief! Williams came running through the alley, from Whitechapel; I caught him - he fell on his knees. I gave him to the person who was pursuing him. About three hours after, as I was shutting up my shop, when my stall-board was removed, the officer said here is a watch - I looked and saw it there; it was about a yard from where Williams was stopped. Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where does the passage lead to - A. Into Church-lane from Whitechapel. . I am a patrol. I was in Whitechapel, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I crossed over, and saw Williams coming out of Spectacle-alley, in a direction from the cry; I took him. A mob were round him - he had been stopped in the alley. I took him, and saw Norris close by; he said it was only a lark. . I am a Bow-street officer. I found the watch under Archer's window, close against the wall, about five minutes before one o'clock on Sunday morning. (Property produced and sworn to.) WILLIAMS - GUILTY. Aged 19.

I am a tea-dealer , and live in Nicholas-lane. About a quarter before nine o'clock on the evening of the 24th of August, I was going down the Minories , and at the corner of Red Lion-court the prisoner made a sudden rush at me, and darted at my watch, I put my hand down to protect it, and seized his hands about the wrist - at that time, I believe, he had the seals in hand - and at that instant I was pulled down by some person from behind; I had seen a man at my side when he came up - I felt a stronger jerk at my chain as I was falling. I held the prisoner fast till two watchmen came up. My gold seals, and part of my chain were gone, they broke by the violence of the pull - he had got from my hold before the watchmen came up - they secured him; they were worth about three guineas. I am sure I had hold of them while the prisoner was attempting to get them from me; I have no doubt of his being the man. I found a hat in a doorway at the corner of the court where we had the struggle, I took it to the watch-house, and he claimed it as his own. Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The person snatched at the seals - A. Yes; the seals might have been separated before I seized his wrist, it was done instantly - I am positive of his person; I found him at the watch-house in four or five minutes. There is a public-house at the other corner of the court, the hat was in the doorway of a private house - nobody came from the public-house. I swear to his dress as well as his countenance. . I am a slop-seller, and live directly opposite the spot, in the Minories. I was standing at my door, heard a noise on the opposite side, instantly ran over, found Phillips on the ground, and the prisoner just leaving him, without a hat. I jumped over Phillips, and pursued the prisoner - I saw another man near Phillips; the prisoner left him first, and was about a yard from him when I first caught sight of him, the second person was then between me and Phillips, we could not pass him to follow the prisoner till we got to where the court widened (he ran down the court); the second man squatted down to hinder me. Phillips called out, \\\"That is him?\\\" I kept within twenty yards of him, and only lost sight of him in turning the corner - he was stopped in my sight. Phillips brought a hat into the watch-house, which he afterwards claimed. Cross-examined. Q. Who stopped him - A. A person coming out of a door-way. . I am a linen-draper, and live next door to Dudderidge, whom I was talking to, when we heard a rush, we ran across, saw Phillips laying down in the court, and followed the prisoner, Dudderidge was before me - I only lost sight of the prisoner while he turned the corner. I am certain he is the man. Phillips brought a hat to the watch-house, which he claimed. We were obliged to push by another man in the court to pursue him. Cross-examined. Q. What became of the man who stopped him - A. I do not know. I called out Stop thief! the man popped out of a door, put his arms across to stop him, he fell, and I took him. . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, he claimed the hat.

On the 11th of February the prisoner came to the shop with another woman, and looked at some prints - none would suit them. I saw the prisoner take the piece of sarsnet out of the window, put it on a chair, and conceal it under her clothes.

The prisoner came into my service on Thursday, the 2d of January, I did not suspect her being pregnant. On the 4th of February , my wife gave me\\\\ in\\\\ formation - I went into the kitchen between seven and eight o'clock at night; Mr. Ellis pointed out something to me on the floor, in consequence of which I fetched Mr. Kerr, and stated my suspicions, and Mr. Ellis spoke to him - he went up to see the prisoner in her bed room. When he came down he stated his apprehensions, and having seen some blood on the stairs leading to the yard, he asked for a candle - I went with him to the privy, and found an infant laying on its back, with the head and part of the neck in the soil; I sent for a person who came in half an hour, and took it up - it was put into a box unwashed. I could see no marks of violence on it in the state it was then in. The constable nailed the box down, and put it in the front vault of my house, and nailed up the door. This was late on Saturday evening - it remained there till Monday morning, when Howell took it away. Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Watson took the child from the privy - A. Yes. Mr. Kerr was present - the soil only covered it as far as the chest. MR. . I am an apothecary. On the 4th of January, Mr. Ellis sent for me about eight o'clock in the evening. I first went to the privy, and on throwing down a piece of lighted paper, I saw the child laying on its back, and the head depressed on the soil. The chest and face were visible, but sunk a little in the soil; Mr. Ellis sent for Watson to take it up; I did not observe any thing about its neck - I went up stairs to the prisoner with Mrs. Ellis, who introduced me as a medical man, and left me with her; I asked if she wished for my assistance, she said No, that she had been poorly, but was better - this was all that passed. Q. Then you had no reason to suppose from what passed, that she had been recently brought to bed - A. Not the least; the child appeared not to have come to maturity by a month or two - I am induced to think it was born alive by its general healthy appearance, but cannot say it was so. A feeling similar to an inclination to stool, is very common in pregnancy. I opened the body and found the lungs inflated, and from that I think it had breathed, but that is not conclusive - it might have imbibed sufficient air, even in parturition so as to have inflated the lungs. Q. You cannot say it was born alive - A. Certainly not. . I am a night-man. I went to the privy with a light, and saw the child laying on the surface of the soil on its back, with its head in the soil; one of my men got it up and put it into a box, it was quite naked; I observed nothing about its body. . I summoned the Coroner's Inquest, and was sent for the body of the child on the 7th, to take it before the Inquest - I went to Mr. Ellis's vault; the servant unnailed the door in my presence, and gave me the box, I took it to St. Marylebone workhouse, and unnailed it, and left it for two hours with the nurses to be washed - I then called for it, and found it laying on a clean table, and a piece of a silk handkerchief laying by its side, which the nurse tied round the neck - I myself had not seen it on the neck before.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"evidence_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 965.0817498483395,\n        \"min\": 6.25,\n        \"max\": 19058.25,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1827,\n        \"samples\": [\n          129.75,\n          1444.0,\n          1177.75\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"valid\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Counsel for the Prosecution, MR. ANDREWS. . I am a patrol on the Foundling Estate; Bernard-street is on my beat, and in the parish of St. Pancras. On the 4th of January, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I was passing Mr. Pugh's house - it was quite foggy and dark. I observed that one of the wooden panes on one side of the scullery door appeared to be out, which made me think somebody was about the place. I went down the area, and found the scullery door partly open - the watchman was coming down the street; we found the area gate unlocked. I told him to keep the gate fast while I went down the steps; I was going down, and found the prisoner coming out of the scullery door. He said he had got up too early to go to work, and that he met two men, who told him to come down to such an area, where they would find plenty of grub, and they would share with him. Q. Had he any thing with him - A. No. Before I took him away I found a sack with five dishes, part of three half-quartern loaves, a piece of beef, two pieces of cheese, a piece of dried salmon, a quantity of butter, and a small pan of kitchen-stuff, all tied up in the sack which was in the scullery. Q. Is the scullery immediately underneath the step of the street door - A. Yes, it is part of the area, which is enclosed. The kitchen door enters into the scullery, and the scullery door into the area. . I am watchman of Bernard-street.

About six o'clock in the morning, the watchman called me, and I found it open; a pane of wood, which was safe when I went to bed, had been taken out; a man could put his body through, and unbolt the door, top and bottom. I saw the sack with the things in it - I had left them all safe - the sack was not there the night before; thirteen plates were tied up in a handkerchief under the sink - I had left them in a plate-rack. I am certain I fastened the doors, and the area gate was locked; the door leading to the kitchen was not opened. Last night I found these things in the water-cistern in the scullery - here is a skeleton key, which opens the area gate easily, also a bottle, a steel, and a flint. Prisoner's Defence.

On Sunday, the 5th of December, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I went down to the Fourteen Acre field, and found a very valuable ram had been killed; the skin and three feet were cut off, and left, but the carcase was gone. I traced the footsteps of two men over the hedge and up to Elstree, to a cottage in which Clark lived - Cartwright lived farther down the village. Next morning I got a warrant to search Clark's house first, and found part of a very fine fat shoulder of mutton, dressed. Clark came in at the time, and we asked him where he bought it? He said at Watford, but afterwards said he thought it was at Jonathan's of Edgware. We then went to Cartwright's, and found two bits of fat mutton, they were parts of a shoulder, and a bag, which was fresh with fat and blood, as if hot meat had been in it. We took them into custody, took a shoe off each of them, and compared them with the foot-marks - they matched in length and breadth. Q. Was there any blood near to where the skin was found - A.

Three days afterwards. I saw the mutton at Field's, and compared the feet with two legs, which were found in a hollow tree. They appeared to match exactly when I first saw them, but they have been so long in the bag that the sinews are contracted. I am a butcher myself; they were jointed in a different way to what butchers would do them. The bag found at Cartwright's was very greasy and bloody - the fat of mutton was very plainly to be seen in it. Cross-examined. Q. If he had bought a sheep's head, and put into the bag, it would have this appearance - A. No, there was suet and kidney fat. . I am a butcher and farmer. On the 7th of December, in the afternoon, a man came to say some mutton was found in a hollow tree in my field. I went to the hollow tree - several men were round it - it was taken out before I got there.

I was present and saw the part of the shoulder which the constable produced - the bone appeared to correspond. I have no doubt but it belonged to the same animal. Cross-examined. Q. The bone was dressed - A. Yes; the other was raw. There might be a bone to fit it which did not belong to it - it matched to a nicety. Roasting would not alter it much. . I am a labourer.
